                1- Not being able to touch the floor (floating)
                <br />
                2- Not moving for 3-4 seconds (you will not be able to move in a
                stuck, whereas with balances you will need to make short,
                precise movements to ensure you stay still)

                1. First, find an area where you can get stuck in (these are
                usually small nooks, corners, or particular surfaces)
                <br />
                2. Jump or fly into the stuck, if done correctly, Mercy should
                not be touching the floor (floating) and not able to move with
                any movement key
                <br />
                3. Once stuck, the game will automatically launch you upwards
                after 3-4 seconds
                <br />
                4. Use Angelic Descent (space) and move towards the checkpoint.

                1. First, find an area where you can balance and get stuck in
                (these are usually surfaces where you will not walk on, but
                glide on)
                <br />
                2. Try to slow yourself to a stop and make small, precise
                movements with WASD (movement keys) to ensure you stay still
                <br />
                3. If done correctly, you will be floating completely still, and
                the game will automatically launch you upwards after 3-4 seconds

            <li>
              A lot of maps require you to keep bhop after the stuck (if you
              need to slingshot into the stuck, consider learning cancel GA
              slingshot/superjump) (FUTURE ME: Make sure to add link to cancel
              GA slingshot/superjump)
            </li>
            <li>
              On some editors/maps you will be able to see if you will retain
              bhop: your staff will glow blue as if you are nano boosted (this
              can be inconsistent though and I would not heavily rely on it)
            </li>
            <li>
              Similar to the sit emote, holding your forward input key
              throughout the stuck and jump throughout the stuck/balance can
              help you go further distances as you will not need to factor in
              your reaction time to click forward/jump
            </li>
            <li>
              Some balance checkpoints may require you to have fast reaction
              time when moving forward after being launched upwards - you can
              achieve this by counting down from 3 whilst staying still and then
              hold your forward input button. You will still launch upwards even
              if you move a tiny bit (as long as youâ€™re coming towards the very
              end of the 3 seconds). Moreover, alongside instantly holding your
              forward button, the tiny distance made before being launched
              upwards can help you reach the checkpoint
